      <p>
       I’m a React developer with a strong focus on building clean, scalable, and user-friendly front-end applications. I work comfortably with React, modern JavaScript, and contemporary UI tools to deliver smooth user experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
     Along with front-end development, I actively practice Data Structures and Algorithms and enjoy solving coding problems to improve my problem-solving and logical thinking skills. I believe strong fundamentals and clean code go hand in hand.
      </p>

      <p>
        I care deeply about performance, accessibility, and writing maintainable code. Outside of coding, I enjoy learning new technologies, improving my DSA skills, and building projects that solve real-world problems.
